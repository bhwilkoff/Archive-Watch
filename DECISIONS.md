# Archive Watch — Architecture & Technology Decisions

Entries are ordered by date. This file is **append-only** — never edit or
remove past decisions. Platform noted where specific; unlabeled = both.

---

## Decision 001 — Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS for Web
*Date: YYYY-MM-DD*

**Decision**: No framework, no build step, no dependencies for the web app.

**Rationale**: GitHub Pages serves static files directly. Framework
abstractions cost more than they save at this scale. Aligns with
clarity-over-cleverness.

**Alternatives considered**: React, Vue, Svelte — all require a build step.

**Trade-offs**: Manual DOM manipulation, no reactive state. Revisit if
component count exceeds ~20.

---

## Decision 002 — Xcode Project at Repository Root
*Date: YYYY-MM-DD*

**Decision**: The `.xcodeproj` lives at the repository root, not in a
subdirectory. Project name has no spaces.

**Rationale**: Xcode Cloud requires `.xcodeproj` at the repository root.
Spaces in paths cause issues with shell scripts, CI/CD, and Xcode Cloud's
project discovery. Lesson learned from Bsky Dreams where
`BskyDreams-iOS/Bsky Dreams/Bsky Dreams.xcodeproj` (two levels deep, spaces)
caused persistent "Project does not exist at root" errors.

**Alternatives considered**: Subdirectory with Xcode Cloud custom workspace
path — fragile, undocumented, breaks on Xcode updates.

**Trade-offs**: Web and iOS files share the same root directory. Use
`.gitignore` to keep build artifacts out of the web deployment.

---

## Decision 003 — Shared Version Config (xcconfig)
*Date: YYYY-MM-DD*

**Decision**: `AppVersion.xcconfig` at repo root defines
`MARKETING_VERSION` and `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION`. All targets reference it.

**Rationale**: Editing version numbers via Xcode's identity panel creates
per-target overrides in `project.pbxproj` that shadow the xcconfig, causing
targets to drift. A single xcconfig is the single source of truth.

**Trade-offs**: Must remember to edit the xcconfig, not the Xcode UI.

---

## Decision 004 — SwiftUI + @Observable + SwiftData (iOS)
*Date: YYYY-MM-DD*

**Decision**: SwiftUI for all UI. `@Observable` (iOS 17 macro) for state
management. SwiftData for local persistence. UIKit only where SwiftUI lacks
a native equivalent.

**Rationale**: Modern Apple stack, minimal boilerplate, no third-party
dependencies.

**Trade-offs**: iOS 17+ minimum deployment target.

---

## Decision 005 — Dual-Platform Feature Parity Model
*Date: YYYY-MM-DD*

**Decision**: Both platforms implement the same core feature set. Track
parity in SCRATCHPAD.md. Platform-specific implementation choices are
acceptable (e.g., Keychain vs localStorage for auth).

**Rationale**: Users expect the same capabilities regardless of platform.
Implementation details can differ to leverage each platform's strengths.

**Trade-offs**: Every feature is effectively built twice. Mitigated by
shared API contracts and design tokens.

---

## Decision 006 — tvOS as the primary (only consumer) platform
*Date: 2026-04-17*

**Decision**: Archive Watch is a tvOS 17+ app. The web scaffold in this
repo is retained only as a future editorial dashboard (curated
`featured.json` on GitHub Pages, consumed by the tvOS client). There is
no iOS companion viewer in the roadmap.

**Rationale**: The Internet Archive's strongest suit — feature films,
classic TV, newsreels, silent cinema — is best experienced at the 10-foot
viewing distance on a large screen with native transport controls. An
iPhone/iPad viewer would dilute focus without meaningfully extending
reach; archival viewing is a living-room activity.

**Alternatives considered**: Universal iOS+tvOS app (would force UI
compromises; tvOS HIG is sufficiently distinct that shared SwiftUI views
degrade both platforms). iPadOS-first (wrong form factor for the
content).

**Trade-offs**: Template's Dual-Platform Feature Parity Model does not
apply. Web directory stays, but only for the editorial curation page.

## Decision 007 — TMDb as primary metadata provider (non-commercial tier)
*Date: 2026-04-17*

**Decision**: The Movie Database (TMDb) is the primary source for
posters, backdrops, cast, crew, runtime, genre, and synopsis enrichment.
Use the free non-commercial tier (~40 req/10s). Required attribution
("This product uses the TMDB API but is not endorsed or certified by
TMDB" plus TMDB logo) is rendered on a dedicated About/Attribution
screen.

**Rationale**: TMDb has the most complete free metadata and artwork
coverage for films and TV. Community-supplied image library is vastly
richer than Archive.org's uploader thumbnails. Its `/find` endpoint lets
us match by IMDb ID, which Archive items commonly carry in their
`external-identifier` field. This identifier chain (Archive → IMDb →
TMDb) is the backbone of our enrichment pipeline.

**Alternatives considered**:
- OMDb — poster access gated behind donation; 1000 req/day too tight.
- IMDb directly — no free public API.
- Wikidata-only — coverage is thin for obscure ephemera and artwork
  must be resolved through Commons anyway.

**Trade-offs**: TMDb commercial terms require negotiation for paid apps.
Resolved by shipping Archive Watch as a **free App Store release** — see
Decision 010.

## Decision 008 — Identifier-chaining enrichment cascade
*Date: 2026-04-17*

**Decision**: Every Archive item is enriched through a fixed cascade:

```
archive.org/metadata/{id}
  → read external-identifier (urn:imdb:tt...)
  → if missing: SPARQL Wikidata by P724 (Internet Archive ID)
  → TMDb /find/{imdb_id} → full movie detail + images
  → Artwork resolver (TMDb poster → Wikidata P18 → Commons category
    → Library of Congress → Archive thumb as final fallback)
  → Normalize to ContentItem schema with controlled taxonomy
```

All enrichment results cache to SwiftData with a tiered TTL (TMDb 30d,
Wikidata 90d, Commons/LoC 180d, Archive metadata 7d). Artwork bytes
cache to `URLCache` at 500 MB disk.

**Rationale**: No single source has sufficient coverage or quality.
Cascading fallbacks make every card look "produced" regardless of which
source ultimately serves it. Persistent caching means the network cost is
paid once per title, across all users of a given install.

**Alternatives considered**: Single-source-per-item (fragile); build an
off-device enrichment pipeline on GitHub Pages (defers complexity but
adds a second deployment surface).

**Trade-offs**: Four external services to harden against failure. Each
step has its own rate limit and User-Agent requirement. Mitigated by a
single `HTTPClient` base that handles 429 + `Retry-After` uniformly.

---

## Decision 009 — No user accounts; all state local
*Date: 2026-04-17*

**Decision**: Archive Watch has no sign-in, no cloud sync, no account
system. Continue Watching, Favorites, and Search History live in local
SwiftData. A future CloudKit sync is possible but explicitly out of
scope for v1.

**Rationale**: Removes the largest friction point for trial use,
simplifies the privacy policy to near-zero, and aligns with the
learning-orientation values ("no funnel, no upsell"). Matches the no-
friction ethos of UHF.

**Alternatives considered**: "Sign in with Apple" + CloudKit sync.
Deferred — low marginal value for a living-room app; most users install
on one device.

**Trade-offs**: No sync across Apple TV units in a household. If the
user buys a new Apple TV, Continue Watching starts fresh. Acceptable for v1.

## Decision 010 — Free App Store release (resolves TMDb commercial question)
*Date: 2026-04-17*

**Decision**: Archive Watch ships as a free, non-commercial App Store
app. No in-app purchases, no subscription, no ads.

**Rationale**: All content is public domain; charging for access would
be ethically awkward. TMDb's non-commercial free tier is the natural
match: no paid relationship with TMDb needed. The app's sustainability
path, if any, is donations to the Internet Archive (surface a link in
Settings) — never to the app itself.

**Alternatives considered**: Paid upfront, "tip jar" IAP, optional
donation sub. All rejected for the reasons above.

**Trade-offs**: No revenue. Development is a labor of love / portfolio
piece. Server-side costs are zero (no backend; curated picks ride on
GitHub Pages). Operational cost is effectively the Apple Developer
Program membership.
